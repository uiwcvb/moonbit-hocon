# Validation contract

- Explicit Wasm-GC and JS targets: no inference from the toolchain default.
- Public API tests plus compiled browser engine, CLI stdin/file/argument and failure exit-code checks.
- 307 seeded bounded malformed inputs including UTF-16 surrogates. The worker has a 20-second limit.
- Local code coverage: `moon coverage analyze -p localreview/hocon -- -f summary`. No coverage upload is configured. Coverage is evidence about current code, not upstream feature coverage.
- Benchmark: 5 warmups and 30 measured documented-example executions; median and p95 recorded locally.
- Generated API and browser artifact must match the same source revision.

CI files are prepared locally; remote CI has not run because this repository has not been uploaded. Compatibility beyond README scope remains unverified.
